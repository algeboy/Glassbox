## Algebraic 

A minimal demonstration of universal algebra varieties and the their associated abstract categories.  This interprets the algebras as objects on the [countable sets](#countable).  Since these categories are abstract, we  consider only their homomorphisms so they are called `Hom` which is a subtype of `ConFun`.  The abstract categories are then demonstrated to inhabit algebraic structures themselves, but now in a larger universe for which we use Agda's own `Set`.


## Countable 

A minimal demonstration of a category of countable sets.  This is created as an abstract category of functions between natural numbers and intervals.  This is a skeleton category so it is categorically equivalent to $Sets$ for the Zermelo Set Theory without Replacement or Choice.  However, as this is a minimal example we do not include most of the necessary enrichments to explore a Set Theory.  In particular we do not expose topos properties.

As it is an abstract category it involves only its functions called `ConFun` for "constructable functions".

This module assumes function extensionality.

## Groups

A special case of the variety of groups demonstrating characteristic structure.
